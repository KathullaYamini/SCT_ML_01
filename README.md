**House Price Prediction** 🏠💸

**Overview ℹ️**

This project predicts house prices using machine learning based on features like size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, and location. The model is trained using linear regression to provide accurate price forecasts.

**Features 📊**

- **beds**: Number of bedrooms
- **baths**: Number of bathrooms
- **size**: Size of the house in square feet
- **zip_code**: Location identifier

**Techniques Used 🛠️**

- **Linear Regression**: Basic model for predicting house prices.
- **Train-Test Split**: Splits data for training and evaluation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization tools for exploratory data analysis.

**Data 📈**

The dataset** HousePrice.csv** includes house-related features and their corresponding prices. The data undergoes preprocessing before being used for training the model.

**Methodology** 🚀

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding relationships and patterns.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing Linear Regression.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy.
5. **Deployment**: Model ready for predictions.
